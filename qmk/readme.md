This zip includes the 2b folder to be copied into the Keyboards/ folder under QMK
I didn't add a simple/default keymap
so this one includes a ton of layers, combos, tapdance, and a buzzer used for some layer changes.

flash using these commands (assuming AVR):
make 2b:danl4:avrdude-split-left        
make 2b:danl4:avrdude-split-rightt
